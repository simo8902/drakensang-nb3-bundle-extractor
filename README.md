### Extracts:

- Meshes -> .nvx2
- Models -> .n3
- Animations -> .nax3 / .nac
- Audio -> `.bank` ‚Üí `WAVE` (1536kbps, pure üî•)
- Shaders -> PDHS (SM3.0 bytecode)
- Sequences -> .pbxml (LMXB binary XML + .bxml tables)
- Data -> .bin
- Maps -> .col / .db4 / .map 
    - CPAM -> collision packages
    - IPAM -> instance packages
    - MOSD -> model/scene object data

## Usage  
simple asf

# neb.py
```bash
py neb.py
```
auto-scans input/ folder recursively for *.nb._* files

# bank.py
```
py bank.py <file1.bank> [file2.bank ...]
```

# sigunature_check.py
```
python sigunature_check.py <file1.bank> [file2.bank ...]
```

# diff.py
```
py {inputFROM} {inputWith} out.txt
```

1. Get main TOC file from current version  
   **__toc_md5hash**  
   **bundles_optional___toc_md5hash**

2. Get the same files from test server  
3. Parse them with **neb.py**  
4. Copy **diff.py** to the output directory where these TOC files are located  
5. Compare with **diff.py**  
6. Copy the new data and extract it with **neb.py**  
7. Set the path in **copy.ps1**  
   **$listFile** is the input file for compare  
   **$src** is the path with new data containing bundles  

# copy.ps1
Change **$src** to the path containing the new data (bundles)  
**$listFile** must point to the input file for comparison  


then copy the difference
