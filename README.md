- Meshes -> .nvx2
- Models -> .n3
- Animations -> .nax3 / .nac
- Audio -> `.bank` ‚Üí `WAVE` (1536kbps, pure üî•)
- Shaders -> PDHS (SM3.0 bytecode)
- Sequences -> .pbxml (LMXB binary XML + .bxml tables)
- Data -> .bin
- Maps -> .col / .db4 / .map 
    - CPAM -> collision packages
    - IPAM -> instance packages
    - MOSD -> model/scene object data

## Usage  
simple asf

# neb.py
```bash
py neb.py
```
auto-scans input/ folder recursively for *.nb._* files

# bank.py
```
py bank.py <file1.bank> [file2.bank ...]
```

# sigunature_check.py
```
python sigunature_check.py <file1.bank> [file2.bank ...]
```

# diff.py
```
py {inputFROM} {inputWith} out.txt
```
first get main toc file e.g. from current version\
## __toc._md5hash\
and\
## bundles_optional___toc._md5hash\
and second get the same from test server
then parse with neb.py\
copy diff.py to output dir where these toc files are located\
compare with diff.py\
then copy the new data, extract it w neb.py\
and set the path in copy.ps e.g.\
$listFile and $src

# copy.ps1
change $src to the path u have new data containing bundles obv\
$listFile with the input file for compare
